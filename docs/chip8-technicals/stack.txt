### Stack ###
#############

The stack is used for the subroutines call (call/ret instruction).
It stores the return address instruction.

Original implementation had size 12 (48 bytes)
@TIP Why stack is 48 bytes if size 12 ?
The emulator can have a lot more

The stack is separated from main memory (cannot be manipulated directly)
