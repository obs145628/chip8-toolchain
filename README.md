# chip8-toolchain

This is a complete toolchain for the CHIP-8, mostly written in C.  
The project is just getting started.

## as

The assembler.  
Takes an assembly source file and produce an object file.

## ld

The linker.  
Takes many object files and combine all symbols, code and data into one binary file.

## rom-builder

The binary generated by ld isn't a ROM. It contain many debug and symbol infos.  
Take this binary and generate a ROM file, compatible with any CHIP-8 emulator.  

## rom2bin

The opposite of rom-builder. Creates a binary compatible file, but without any symbol information.

## emulator

Run a CHIP-8 ROM.  
Can also run a binary generated by the linker.  

## debugger

Run a CHIP-8 binary using my own Debugger (ODB).  

## cl-lanexpr

Compiler for my really simple programming language LExpr.  
CHIP-8 backend generates assembly.
